Django DAG
----------

.. Note:

    This is an unoffical 1.5.0 branch for Python 3 and Django2.2+ compatibility,
    every thing on this branch except the version number has either been pulle
    by elapso/django-dag or is an outstanding PR.
    (With the exception of the NodeOrdering, which iwll become a PR 
     once we have unittests )
    Ths version number has been bumped purely to aid the installation tools,
    and may not have all the features that the upstream 1.5.0 ends up with

Django-dag is a small reusable app which implements a Directed Acyclic Graph.

Usage
.....

Django-dag uses abstract base classes, to use it you must create your own
concrete classes that inherit from Django-dag classes.

The `dag_test` app contains a simple example and a unit test to show
you its usage.

Example::

    class ConcreteNode(node_factory('ConcreteEdge')):
        """
        Test node, adds just one field
        """
        name = models.CharField(max_length = 32)

    class ConcreteEdge(edge_factory(ConcreteNode, concrete = False)):
        """
        Test edge, adds just one field
        """
        name = models.CharField(max_length = 32, blank = True, null = True)


Tests
.....

Unit tests can be run with just django installed at the base directory by running
   `python manage.py test`
